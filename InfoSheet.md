Additional comments (including problems and extra credit):

    I never fully finished the 'public ArrayList<String> retrievePredictions()'
    method, yet my code still ran perfectly fine under the autograder on GradeScope.
    If points need to be taken off because of this, I understand as I never finished
    it in the first place!
