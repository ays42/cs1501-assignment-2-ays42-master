# Put your writeup here

    Upon first receiving this project, I was easily able to understand the
reason why we were given this assignment: How would one properly traverse a DLB Trie with the
given variables being creating an auto complete program and a dictionary? In order to do this,
I began by working on the add() algorithm and started simply looping through the inputted
word, traversing through the DLB Trie and checking whether the charcters matched. I soon
realized I would need a private recursive helper method that would initially  traverse and add
every word to every node of the DLB Trie. I used the cases of whether the root were null and
whether the node was a child. Soon, I noticed that the boolean variable resultAdd() would
become a key checking-point in my algorithm's iteration, as it would correctly organize the
inputted word's status of its presence within the DLB Trie. My cases were whether the word
already existed so it didn't need adding, the word did exist and needs adding, or the word shared
a similarity with another word, so it was added as its sibling. If none of these cases worked by
themselves, I knew I'd have to check the siblings of the child node. This step was crucial as we
had to call the recursive add_Helper() method on the inputted node's siblings. Earlier, I mentioned
having to check whether a word would be added through a sibling, and at first I didn't realize that
these nodes would have to be accessible from both sides. I had to get some outside help as I was
struggling with what was going wrong, and then I knew to make it a doubly linked list. For the
case when I recursively called the function, I made the doubly linked list function horizontally
and vertically. After the bulk of this main algorithm was done, I was able to finish the add()
method by using the helper to determine whether the word was successfully added to the DLB Trie.
    Many of the other methods were fairly simple to achieve; for example, I mainly defined the
isWord() method in the recursive cases of the add_Helper() method, so all I had to do was verify
that the word was not null and I could return the result (I can say the same for the reset() method).
Once I got to the advance() method, I knew it would be a similar process as the add(). I started by
creating a recursive helper method that would search the DLB Trie for the current running prefix - the
base case of course being if the currentPrefix were empty, checking if the letter was the root, and
instinctively using a similar algorithm as add()'s that would traverse the "temporary" node's data in
order to find the given word; this "temporary" node would be set back to the original if the prefix
doesn't exist in the DLB. I then had to exit this traversal to make more cases to update the running
prefix - I checked if the current node/node's child were null, and traversed through the child's
siblings in case the "temporary" node didn't match. I finally needed to make 3 more cases: one that
would check if the temporary node didn't match, one that would return true if the running prefix was
a word, and the final one that would end the running prefix.
    The final 3 methods that I finished were retreat(), and retrievePrediction() + its helper method.
The retreat method was used on the running prefix at all times (because the user would be constantly
typing). What its cases would do would be to check if the prefix matched the string, if the prefix
was longer than the string, or if you didn't need to update the node whilst retreating. I then
preemptively believed that this was all the code needed for this method, so I was shocked when I ran
into troubles with the auto grader. I was then dumbfounded to realize that I didn't even code the part
where the retreat() method would... well retreat! I then knew to traverse up to the parent node, and
did this by going backwards through the siblings - I was actually confused as to why the previousSibling
variable was never used in my code when I first submitted it, so it all started making sense. The
retrievePrediction() method would be the most challenging part of this project for me, as I always
struggled with implementing backtracking algorithms. However, with the help of some fellow classmates
and tutors, I was able to solve this method. My base cases were whether the node was null or a word, and
responding appropriately to that; I then knew I would need to make another helper method to finish the
second part of its algorithm. I started by preventing the appending algorithm to reach the bottom of the
DLB Trie by using a while loop - inside I had cases that would break the loop if the node was a word, or
append its data and traverse its children while it was not a word. However, I knew I would also have to
check if the inputted node was a word itself; if it was I would backtrack from the node's sibling.
    After reading the instructor's Javadoc comments in the interface, I precisely understood the runtime
boundaries I was given and respected them fully - I don't believe any of my methods would have a worse
runtime than the one specified in the instructor's comments. My add() runs in O(26*word.length()), my
advance() and retreat() run in O(26) time, the reset(), isWord(), and getNumberOfPredictions() ran in
O(1), the retrievePrediction() methods ran in O(length of returned word), and the void add() method ran
in O(26*length of running prefix).
